                For me a good day starts with coffee.  A better day starts after a full nights sleep. </p>

                <p>I have been working from home on and off for almost 20 years.  I just finished managing two major home remodels that were profitable.
                    </p>
                
                <p>I have been married for 23 years and I  have four kids.  My husband works in telephone engineering and design.  He likes to mod Nerf guns for fun, but he never has the time. My 20 year old daughter is working on her associate's of science.  She DM's a large DnD group at my house every week.  My 17 year old daughter is the Vice President for her Senior Class Student Body Officers.  She is studying Python and is an excellent artist.  My 14 year old son is a Student Body Officer for his Freshman class.  He plays the Bass in his School Rock Band.  My 9 year old son is enjoying his class with "Making Tracks Earth Education" where he learns wilderness survival & nature skills.  He is asking for a drum set for Christmas. 
                    </p>
                
                <p>I volunteer in a secular community called Salt Lake Oasis.  Besides coding, blogging and social media, I like to hang out with friends, garden, draw, bake and go out in nature.
